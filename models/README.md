Lego Models
===========

Create a model
==============

- use [Lego Digital Designer](http://ldd.lego.com/en-us/)
- save your model
- the file will be called something like foo.lxf
- this file is actually a zip file

Extract a model
===============

- you can view the contents with 

    tar -tvf foo.lxf

- you can extract the contents with 

    unzip foo.lxf

or

    tar -xvf foo.lxf

One of the files will be called  "IMAGE100.LXFML"

- this is an XML file that has all your model in it


Import a model
==============

- you can "Import Model" and select the LXFML file
- ...or you can zip up the model, give the archive an extension of .lxf, and put it in your Models directory
